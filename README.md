Project for AP Computer Science, Needham High School

This is a project I did for my AP Computer Science class that implements a CLI for a chess game that supports basic game saving, enforces the rules of the game, and implements pawn promotion, au passant, etc.

The actual program is within the Board.java class.  To play the game, run `javac Board.java; java Board`.
